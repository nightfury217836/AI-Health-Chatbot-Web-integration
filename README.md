Ever wondered if Artificial Intelligence can act like a doctor? 🤔 In this project, I built an AI-powered Healthcare Chatbot that predicts diseases from your symptoms using Machine Learning in Python, and I integrated it with a web interface so anyone can interact with it online! 🚑💻

Here’s what you’ll see in this end-to-end project:
✅ Symptom extraction with NLP – understand what the user inputs
✅ Training a Machine Learning model – Random Forest Classifier for disease prediction
✅ Interactive chatbot interface – asks follow-up questions dynamically
✅ Disease prediction with confidence scores – know how likely a disease is
✅ Health tips, precautions, and motivational advice – for a complete experience
✅ Web integration – deploy your AI solution for real-time interactions

✨ Learning outcomes:

Collect, clean, and preprocess medical datasets

Train ML models for symptom-based disease detection

Build a chatbot that interacts like a real healthcare assistant

Deploy your AI model through a simple web interface for user access

📌 Technologies & Tools Used:
Python | Scikit-learn | Pandas | NLP | Flask / Streamlit | HTML/CSS | Machine Learning

💬 Perfect for beginners, students, and ML enthusiasts who want to see a full project from scratch. By the end, you’ll have a working AI chatbot deployed on the web, ready to impress in your portfolio.
